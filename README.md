## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Start:

Clone the repo, using ```git clone https://github.com/jash-j3/E-Commerce-Website.git``` and open the terminal in the parent folder.
Then run: ```npm i --f```
After all the dependencies have been installed, run ```npm start```.

Then change the directory to the "Backend DB" folder. ```cd Backend\(DB\)/``` .
Again run, : ```npm i --f```
After all the dependencies have been installed, run ```npm start```.


Wait for 5 seconds, till you see "Database Connection is ready...".

The site is working!

## Some details about our Web-App
The website, CartDiya is a MERN App. The database is on MongoDB Atlas. It is a kind of replicate of an E-Commerce Website. It has an asthetic homepage, profile page, login/signup facility, carts, and even payment gateway. 

## For Payment (buy a product):
For this, click on Buy Now on the product page, or add the required products to the card, and then Buy. This will redirect to the Stripe Payment Page.
Real payments have not been enabled for obvious reasons. Anyways, Stripe provides test cards to check the gateway. Here are some of the cards (successful payments) that stripe provides. You can use any of these with a valid date and CVC.
